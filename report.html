<p>3. Usability Test Details: <br>
    <p>The feedback provided from the Usability test was very good overall</p>
    <p>The website was intuitive enough for the user to nagivate without any instructions</p>
    <p>Things were easy to find and had a good balance with images and text</p>
    <p>Design looks modern and sharp</p>

    <p>However two points of improvements were made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>It was not easy to find the sample. To fix that, the Gallery tab name include the name Sample, to be more meaningful.</li>
        <li>The Sample form did not have any feedback if one field was missing. </li>
    </ul>
